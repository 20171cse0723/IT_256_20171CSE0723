<p id="secondpara"style="color:cyan;">Khan began his career with appearances in several television series in the late 1980s. He made his Bollywood debut in 1992 with Deewana. Early in his career, Khan was recognised for portraying villainous roles in the films Darr (1993), Baazigar (1993) and Anjaam (1994). He then rose to prominence after starring in a series of romantic films, including Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995), Dil To Pagal Hai (1997), Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998), Mohabbatein (2000) and Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...

<p id="thirdpara"style="color:yellow;">As of 2015, Khan is co-chairman of the motion picture production company Red Chillies Entertainment and its subsidiaries, and is the co-owner of the Indian Premier League cricket team Kolkata Knight Riders and the Caribbean Premier League team Trinbago Knight Riders. He is a frequent television presenter and stage show performer. The media often label him as "Brand SRK" because of his many endorsement and entrepreneurship ventures. Khan's philanthropic endeavours have provided health care and disaster relief, and he was honoured with UNESCO's Pyramide con Marni award in 2011 for his support of children's education and the World Economic Forum's Crystal Award in 2018 for his leadership in championing women's and children's rights in India. He regularly features in listings of the most influential people in Indian culture, and in 2008, Newsweek named him one of their fifty most powerful people in the world.</p>
<p id="fourthpara"style="color:orange;">Khan was born on 2 November 1965 into a Muslim family in New Delhi.[2] He spent the first five years of his life in Mangalore, where his maternal grandfather, Ifthikar Ahmed, served as the chief engineer of the port in the 1960s.[8][9][b] Khan's paternal grandfather, Meer Jan Muhammad Khan, was an ethnic Pashtun (Pathan).[11][12] Khan's father, Meer Taj Mohammed Khan, was an Indian independence activist from Peshawar who campaigned alongside the Khudai Khidmatgar, a Pashtun nonviolent resistance movement led by Abdul Ghaffar Khan (also known as Bacha Khan or the "Frontier Gandhi") that advocated for a united and independent India free from British rule.[13] Meer was a follower of Abdul Ghaffar Khan,[14] and affiliated with the Indian National Congress.[11] As of 2010, Khan's paternal family was still living in the Shah Wali Qataal area of Peshawar's Qissa Khwani Bazaar.[11] They speak Hindko and claim to be originally from Kashmir.[11][15] Meer moved to New Delhi in 1948 after the partition of India.[16] Khan's mother, Lateef Fatima, was the daughter of a senior government engineer.[17][c] His parents were married in 1959.[20] Khan described himself on Twitter as "half Hyderabadi (mother), half Pathan (father), [and] some Kashmiri (paternal grandmother)".</p>
<p id="fifthpara"style="color:purple;">Khan grew up in the Rajendra Nagar neighbourhood of Delhi.[22] His father had several business ventures including a restaurant, and the family lived a middle-class life in rented apartments.[23] Khan attended St. Columba's School in central Delhi where he excelled in his studies and in sports such as hockey and football,[24] and received the school's highest award, the Sword of Honour.[23] Initially Khan aspired to pursue a career in sports, however owing to a shoulder injury in his early years meant that he could no longer play.[25] Instead, in his youth, he acted in stage plays and received praise for his imitations of Bollywood actors, of which his favourites were Dilip Kumar, Amitabh Bachchan, and Mumtaz.[26] One of his childhood friends and acting partners was Amrita Singh, who became a Bollywood actress.[27] Khan enrolled at Hansraj College (1985–88) to earn his bachelor's degree in Economics, but spent much of his time at Delhi's Theatre Action Group (TAG),[28] where he studied acting under the mentorship of theatre director Barry John.[29] After Hansraj, he began studying for a master's degree in Mass Communications at Jamia Millia Islamia, but left to pursue his acting career.[30] He also attended the National School of Drama in Delhi during his early career in Bollywood.[31] His father died of cancer in 1981,[d] and his mother died in 1991 from complications of diabetes.[34] After the death of their parents, his older sister, Shahnaz Lalarukh, born in 1960,[35] fell into a depressed state and Khan took on the responsibility of caring for her.[32][36] Shahnaz continues to live with her brother and his family in their Mumbai mansion.</p>
<p id="sixthpara"style="color:red;">Although Khan was given the birth name Shahrukh Khan, he prefers his name to be written as Shah Rukh Khan, and is commonly referred to by the acronym SRK.[1] He married Gauri Chibber, a Punjabi Hindu, in a traditional Hindu wedding ceremony on 25 October 1991, after a six-year courtship.[38][39] They have a son Aryan (born 1997)[40] and a daughter Suhana (born 2000).[41] In 2013, they became parents of a third child, a son named AbRam,[42] who was born through a surrogate mother.[43] Both his elder children have expressed interest in entering the entertainment industry; Khan has stated that Aryan, who is studying film at the USC School of Cinematic Arts in California, aspires to become a writer-director,[44][45] while Suhana, who served as assistant director for Khan's film Zero (2018), is studying drama and acting at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts for higher education.[46][47] Suhana made her acting debut in November 2019, in a short film titled "The Grey Part of Blue."[48] According to Khan, while he strongly believes in Islam, he also values his wife's religion. His children follow both religions; at his home the Qur'an is situated next to the Hindu deities.[49]</p>
<p id="seventhpara"style="color:indigo;">Khan's first starring role was in Lekh Tandon's television series Dil Dariya, which began shooting in 1988, but production delays led to the Raj Kumar Kapoor directed 1989 series Fauji becoming his television debut instead.[50] In the series, which depicted a realistic look at the training of army cadets, he played the leading role of Abhimanyu Rai.[51][52] This led to further appearances in Aziz Mirza's television series Circus (1989–90) and Mani Kaul's miniseries Idiot (1991).[53] Khan also played minor parts in the serials Umeed (1989) and Wagle Ki Duniya (1988–90),[53] and in the English-language television film In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones (1989).[54] His appearances in these serials led critics to compare his look and acting style with those of the film actor Dilip Kumar,[55] but Khan was not interested in film acting at the time, thinking that he was not good enough.[53][56]

Khan changed his decision to act in films in April 1991,[57] citing it as a way to escape the grief of his mother's death.[58] He moved from Delhi to Mumbai to pursue a full-time career in Bollywood, and was quickly signed to four films.[57] His first offer was for Hema Malini's directorial debut Dil Aashna Hai,[31][51] and by June, he had started his first shoot.[59] His film debut was in Deewana, which was released in June 1992.[60] In it he starred alongside Divya Bharti as the second male lead behind Rishi Kapoor. Deewana became a box office hit and launched Khan's Bollywood career;[61] he earned the Filmfare Best Male Debut Award for his performance.[62] Also released in 1992 were Khan's first films as the male lead, Chamatkar, Dil Aashna Hai, and the comedy Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman, which was his first of many collaborations with the actress Juhi Chawla.[63] His initial film roles saw him play characters who displayed energy and enthusiasm. According to Arnab Ray of Daily News and Analysis, Khan brought a new kind of acting as he was "sliding down stairs on a slab of ice, cartwheeling, somersaulting, lips trembling, eyes trembling, bringing to the screen the kind of physical energy ... visceral, intense, maniacal one moment and cloyingly boyish the next."[64]
1993–1994: Anti-hero

Among his 1993 releases, Khan garnered the most appreciation for portraying villainous roles in two box office hits: an obsessive lover in Darr, and a murderer in Baazigar.[65] Darr marked the first of Khan's many collaborations with filmmaker Yash Chopra and his company Yash Raj Films. Khan's stammering and the use of the phrase "I love you, K-k-k-Kiran" were popular with audiences.[66] For Darr he received a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Negative Role, also known as the Best Villain Award, but lost to Paresh Rawal for Sir.[67] Baazigar, in which Khan played an ambiguous avenger who murders his girlfriend, shocked Indian audiences with an unexpected violation of the standard Bollywood formula.[68] In The Cambridge Companion to Modern Indian Culture, Sonal Khullar called the character "the consummate anti-hero".[69] His performance in Baazigar, which would be his first of many appearances with actress Kajol, won Khan his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor.[70] In 2003, the Encyclopedia of Hindi Cinema stated that Khan "defied the image of the conventional hero in both these films and created his own version of the revisionist hero".[70] Also in 1993, Khan performed a nude scene with Deepa Sahi in Maya Memsaab, although parts of it were censored by the Central Board of Film Certification.[71] The ensuing controversy prompted him to eschew such scenes in future roles.[72]

In 1994, Khan played a love-struck musician in Kundan Shah's comedy-drama film Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa opposite Deepak Tijori and Suchitra Krishnamurthy, which he later professed was his favourite role. His performance earned him a Filmfare Critics Award for Best Performance, and in a retrospective review from 2004, Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com referred to it as Khan's best performance, saying "He is spontaneous, vulnerable, boyish, mischievous and acting straight from the heart."[73] Also in 1994, Khan won the Filmfare Best Villain Award for his role as an obsessive lover in Anjaam, co-starring Madhuri Dixit and Deepak Tijori.[70] At the time, playing antagonistic roles was considered risky to a leading man's career in Bollywood. Ray subsequently credited Khan for taking "insane risks" and "pushing the envelope" by choosing to play such characters, through which he established his career in Bollywood.[64] The director Mukul S. Anand called him "the new face of the industry" at the time.[58]</p>
